# Instruction

The game is played with a deck of cards for each player, with each deck consisting of Bodhisattva cards and action
cards. The Bodhisattvas represent the enlightened beings that are striving to help sentient beings, while the action
cards represent various abilities or actions that the Bodhisattvas can take.

The game also includes a deck of sentient being cards, which represent the various beings that inhabit the six realms.
These cards are shuffled and placed in a stack face down on the table, forming a "realm deck."

Each player takes turns drawing a card from the realm deck and placing it face up on the table in one of the six realms.
The six realms represent different states of suffering and enlightenment, and each realm has its own rules and
requirements for how the Bodhisattvas can interact with the sentient beings there.

On their turn, a player can play a Bodhisattva card from their hand and use its abilities to help the sentient being in
the realm. They can also play action cards to gain additional abilities or to disrupt their opponent's plans.

The goal of the game is to help as many sentient beings as possible, either by liberating them from suffering or by
guiding them towards enlightenment. Players can earn points by helping sentient beings, and the first player to reach a
certain number of points wins the game.
